<h1>Prototype with your smartphone.</h1>

ZIG SIM is an application to develop prototypes utilizing sensors on smartphones.

Smartphones are getting smarter - they ship with bunch of features and sensors.
However, developing apps with them is not as easy as you'd expect.

This is why we developed ZIG SIM.
ZIG SIM allows you to easily monitor the data from sensors and APIs of your device.
You can also send the data to the PC in JSON/OSC format over TCP/UDP protocol.

You can explore the possibility to create wearable devices and IoT, without buying new gadgets.
