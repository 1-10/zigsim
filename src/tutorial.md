Next, go to **Sensor** tab and select the commands to get data.
Tap `Acceleration`, `Gyro` and `Quaternion` to enable these commands.

After that, go to **Start** tab to start monitoring.
You will see the data being displayed on the screen.

### 4. Press `Start` Button in ZIG Indicator

Finally you can see the result in ZIG Indicator.
Press `Start` button in the sidebar to start monitoring.

You can see the motion data visualized on the screen.
Try shaking the device to make sure the data is updated correctly.
